# Web Scraper With BeautifulSoup on Allsides website

In this project, I have showed the workings of how to scrap a simple website. For the project I have followed a wonderful tutorial by Brendan Martin. 
I will be releasing other Web Scraping Projects, as I go on learning this new skill.

```
The Project is divided into two Parts:
* Extracting the Data from [allsides.com](https://www.allsides.com/media-bias/media-bias-ratings) website and storing it in json file
* From the json file, we will process the data and do a simple bar graph to see the User Agree and Disagree.

#To clone this project 
```bash
git clone 
```

#Package Requirements
```bash
pip install requests
pip install beautifulsoup4
pip install lxml
```

Other than the packages for BeautifulSoup, make sure to install basic ML packages such as 
```bash
pip install pandas
pip install matplotlib.pyplot as plt 
```
